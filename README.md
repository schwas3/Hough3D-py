This is a python implementation of the source code associated with (https://doi.org/10.5201/ipol.2017.208):

The exact performance of the code will eventually be modifed to be application specific and NOT exactly replicate the behavior of the source code.

-----

Code is currently written to require manual changing of input parameters in `hough3dlines.py` (and in other files??). The output is textbased only, `python hough3dlines.py > output_file.out` will produce output to a file.

To-do:
- Argparse
- Visualization (+boolean arg, output file arg, more parameter args)
- Output points in lines (either ID's or lists of points or ? maybe some intergration with flow is possible?)
- Output confidence values? i.e. eigenvalues or LSQ-fit value to identify line strengths? (Note: this is obtainable with a description of a line and list of points, resource scope exceeded?)
- Optimization of sphere.py - don't allow 3 forbidden vertices to produce a vertex (this is an important nuance, forbidden vertices and allowable vertices may produce allowable vertices)
  - Not sure if this is actually possible... Triangles can be forbidden but can vertices?
  - sphere.py is likely not as impactful on performance as the granularity itself (i.e. making the list is cheap, applying it is expensive and not impacted by sphere.py)
- Add energy dependent functionalities? Not likely, but could have minEnergy? Again, this likely exceeds the scope of this resource.
- Optimize code by using list indices instead of lists.
  - Rather than initialize `X` and remove candidate points in `Y` from `X`, include a boolean flag in `X` and `Y` (`X` init to all `1` and `Y` to all `0`) and perhaps make the flag a line index in `Y` (would instead init `Y` to all `-1` and assign line index as they are found)?
  - ?
